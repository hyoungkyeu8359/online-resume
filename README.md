# Host your resume in GitHub Pages

## Purpose
The purpose of this README is to explain how to host a resume on GitHub Pages. Also, this will introduce and demo principles of Andrew Etter's book Modern Technical Writing.

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Your resume formatted in Markdown
- A text edittor of your choice

You will need to create a GitHub account to host your resume in GitHub Pages for free. Click [here](https://github.com/) to create an account.

Also, you will need to convert your resume into Markdown format. Don't worry if you are new to Markdown. There are websites that provides tutorials for beginners. I strongly recommend you to visit this [website](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) to get yourself familar to Markdown. Once you are done, refer to this [link](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) as a cheatsheet.

You will need a text edittor to write your resume into Markdown format (and possibly preview it). I have listed the possible text edittors that you might use:
- Atom
- Notepads
- Vim
- Visual Studio Code (recommended)
- XCode

I recommend Visual Studio Code as you can install an extension tool to preview any Markdown-formatted file.

**â€œWhy is my resume not showing up?**

Answer: There are a few possibilities:
