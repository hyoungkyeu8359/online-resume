# Host a resmue online

## Purpose
The purpose of this README is to explain how to host a resume on GitHub Pages. Also, this will introduce and demo principles of Andrew Etter's book Modern Technical Writing.

Prerequisites: This should include a resume formatted in Markdown.
i) Include a link to a good Markdown tutorial under “More Resources.” You do not need to explain
how to use Markdown.

Instructions, including animated GIF
i) Use headings and numbered lists
ii) Remember to use each step to explain BOTH how to follow Etter’s protocol and how to host a
resume in GitHub Pages or Codeberg Pages. It’s up to you whether you 1) begin with Etter’s
general process and then demonstrate the process with a practical step involving your resume,
or 2) begin with the practical steps for hosting a resume and relate each practical step to a
concept in Etter’s book.
iii) Add an animated GIF: Include a demo using an animated GIF in your README. The GIF should
feature your own resume (showing your own name) in the GIF.
iv) More Resources: include:
(1) a Markdown tutorial
(2) a link to Etter’s book
(3) at least one other resource

Authors and Acknowledgments: credit template authors and group members

FAQs Add (and answer) two FAQs, as described below:
(1) A question about the overall process, such as “Why is Markdown better than a word
processor?”
(2) A question about the practical details, such as “Why is my resume not showing up?”
You may use the example FAQs, or come up with your own.
